# LeetCode-algorithms
### Solutions of algorithmic exercises from LeetCode site. 

LeetCode OJ is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. 

I used [LeetCode OJ](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) to measure my progress in understanding algorithms and data structures, and also for interview preparation.

### Usage

Names of the above solutions are directly correlated with the names of LeetCode exercises. For example:

Exercise: [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/) coresponds to my Java solution: [ReverseString344.java](https://github.com/DianaLuca/LeetCode-algorithms/blob/master/ReverseString344.java)

```java
public String reverseString(String s) {

    return new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();
  }
```

I think that solving problems on LeetCode since it's an online judge platform where you can code and submit your solution to see if you have solved it correctly.
It is also possible to run your code on your own test cases.

Anyways, if your solution failed too many times :crying_cat_face: , hopefully you get inspired by my java solutions.
