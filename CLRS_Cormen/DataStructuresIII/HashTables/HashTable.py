A hash table is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries. 
Although searching for an element in a hash table can take as long as searching for an element in a linked list O(n) time in the worst case
in practice, hashing performs extremely well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time to search for an element in a hash table is O(1)
