"""
Given a list of float numbers, insert “+”, “-”, “*” or “/” between each consecutive pair of numbers to find the maximum value you can get. For simplicity, assume that all operators are of equal precedence order and evaluation happens from left to right.
Example:
(1, 12, 3) -> 1 + 12 * 3  = 39
1, 12, -3

1 - 12 * (-3) = -11 * (-3) = 33
